Lottery Web App

This is a web app that allows users to play a simple lottery game. <br>
The focus of this project is to focus on implementing secure coding practices and to ensure that the app is secure and free from vulnerabilities.  <br>
To run the app locally, clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal:
```
flask run --cert=adhoc
```
The app will be running on https://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

If a site not secure warning appears, click on the advanced button and proceed to the site. This is just because I have implemented a dummy SSL certificate for the app.
