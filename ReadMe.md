Lottery Web App

This is a simple web app that allows users to play a lottery game. The user can select 6 numbers from 1 to 20 and then click the play button to see if they have won. The app will randomly select 6 numbers and compare them to the user's numbers. If the user has selected all 6 numbers correctly, they win the jackpot. If they have selected 3 or more numbers correctly, they win a smaller prize. If they have selected less than 3 numbers correctly, they lose. <br>
The focus of this project is to focus on implementing secure coding practices and to ensure that the app is secure and free from vulnerabilities.  <br>
To run the app locally, clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal:
```
flask run --cert=adhoc
```
The app will be running on https://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

If a site not secure warning appears, click on the advanced button and proceed to the site. This is just because I have implemented a dummy SSL certificate for the app.
